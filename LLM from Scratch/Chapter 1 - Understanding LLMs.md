# Understanding LLMs  

- What does **"understanding"** mean for LLMS ?  
	-> LLMs don't think like humans -> no human-like consciousness.  
	-> They "understand" only in the sense thaty they can generate meaningful, coherent text. 

-  why are LLMs powerful ?  
	-> Built on **Transformer** architecture.  
	-> Trained on huge amounts of text -> learn patterns, context, and meaning.    
	-> LLM = type of neural network that can read, write, reply like a human.

-  Parameters  
	-> Parameters = adjustable values in training  
	-> Used to predict the next word  
	 -> Modern LLMs -> billions of parameters.  
	 GPT-3 has 96 transformer layers & 175 billion parameters.   

-  Applications  
   -> Translation, text generation, chatbots (chatGPT, Gemini).   
   -> Custom LLMs: specialized for domains (e.g. -> bloomberfGPT -> finance, Medical LLMs -> healthcare)  
   -> Benefits fo custom models:  
	   - Better task accuracy  
	   - Improved data privacy
